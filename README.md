# vs-writer-logitech

Vercel-deployed writing-assistant web app that takes Logitech device input and produces AI-assisted writing output. Vite + React 19 + Upstash Redis, with Framer Motion and GSAP driving the interaction layer.

**Deployment note:** despite the folder name, this codebase is what deploys as the Vercel project **`aldus`** — production at **showcase.optimizely.com**, pre-prod previews aliased to **aldus-preprod.vercel.app**. It has grown into the Aldus showcase (retail, FinServ, ABM pages) with the live Edit mode. There is no separate "aldus" repo; deploy from here.

## Purpose

An experiment in input-device–driven writing: capture raw input from Logitech hardware (mouse gestures, MX Creative dial, etc.) and map it into writing operations (rewrite, expand, simplify, tone shift).

## Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite
- **Animation:** Framer Motion, GSAP
- **Styling:** Tailwind + custom CSS
- **State/storage:** Upstash Redis
- **Build:** SSR via esbuild
- **Deploy:** Vercel

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Edit mode (live)

The showcase's "Edit mode" (`src/components/EditMode.tsx` + `api/opal-edit-stream.ts`) streams the `account_page_live_edit` Opal specialized agent over SSE and animates its edits on-page before the agent commits a single `update_page`. It absorbed the retired standalone `aldus-live-edit` app (June 2026).

Server-side environment (Vercel project `aldus`; also in local `.env.local`):

```bash
OPAL_PAT=          # Opal Personal Access Token — required, never sent to the browser
OPAL_BASE_URL=     # default https://opal.optimizely.com
OPAL_INSTANCE_ID=  # default 4f42a24e93f945bcb262bff01a9a1562
OPAL_AGENT_ID=     # default 6c6d1d88-55ee-4f9c-a2d3-28de4bee1149 (account_page_live_edit)
```

Without `OPAL_PAT` the endpoint responds with a clean SSE error ("Server is missing OPAL_PAT"); the older fire-and-forget webhook lives at `api/opal-feedback.ts`.
